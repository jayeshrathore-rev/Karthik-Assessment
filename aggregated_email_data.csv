Hi Riley,
I wanted to reach out to see what you are specifically looking for moving into your next home,
If you could answer a few questions I would love to figure out what is best
ðŸ˜Š
How many occupants will be living in the apartment? Anyone under 18?
When are you looking to move?
How long are you looking to lease for?
How many bedrooms are you looking for?
Is their a price range you are budgeting for?
Are you bringing any pets with you?
Is there anything that is a dealbreaker for you to have or not have in the unit or on the property?
If you have any questions I can answer for you please don""™t hesitate!!

We have a top floor 2 bedroom 2 bathroom that will be coming available at the end of  September which we are able to hold until 10/14 which is going for $1697 a month (pricing includes high speed internet, cable, trash and pest control fees).
Being conveniently located right off US HWY 70 and right next to a sheetz it makes getting everywhere you need to go super easy! Did I mention the one month FREE rent for November?!

Evaluation Summary:
Rob was very enthusiastic about the community and apartments and really was talkative and passionate.  He almost provided information so quick, it was hard to take it all in and he never found out what exactly I was looking for so gave me a lot of irrelevant information to digest and pick through.  He did ask me some things such as parking, pets, what I did for work.  He definitely was selling the complex but never created urgency in me.

Evaluation Summary:
Patience was pleasant but didn't really give much information about the apartment or complex.  When asked to walk me through the website, she said it was pretty explanatory and she would send me a video which will show me a lot more.  I did not find the website very helpful either as it had no neighborhood map or area pictures.  Patience also did not try to find out anything about me or what I needed in an apartment and community.

Amelia Station <Leasing_Office-ameliastation@knck.io>,Thank you for Calling!,2024-09-25 17:53:13,"*|MC:SUBJECT|*
Hi Jamie,
Thank you again for calling to inquire about our apartment homes here at  Amelia Station. I am happy to help with your search and if you have any additional questions or concerns that we did not cover, please do not hesitate to let me know. I also am so sorry, but I forgot to mention our special! If you can move in by/before October 31st, you will receive November rent free. ðŸ ̃Š I know you were looking to move in mid-November, but if you are able to make this work, I think you would be able to save some money.
Our two bedroom homes are a spacious 1154 square feet and the ones we spoke about over the phone are listed below. These prices will include the monthly fees of cable, high-speed wireless internet, trash and pest control. If you would like to add the stainless steel appliances, please let me know and we can get them installed for you.
#1006-100:
1st floor, pond view, $1747. With stainless steel = $1797 -Available 10/25-11/14.
#1010-300:
3rd floor, community view, $1697. With stainless steel = $1747 -Available 11/04-11/18
You can
click here
for our virtual tour. This will lead you to our website, which will also have our photos, amenities and application. If you do choose to move forward, the application fee is $50 per adult or $60 per married couple. There is a $100 holding fee that you will pay up front, but you will receive this back on your move in day. The only time you would lose this fee is if the application is cancelled. Once the application is approved, the security deposit will be due. Nothing else will be due until your move in day. As for your pup, there is a non-refundable pet fee of $250 and it would be $20 monthly for pet rent.
I hope this covers everything. Again, we would love to have you here and we hope to chat with you soon. ðŸ ̃Š

I was initially greeted by a manger a think. She asked how she could help and i stated I had a tour. She first asked who i had a tour with and then said oh did you set it up yesterday. I said yes. Then she asked me what my name was and i gave her my first name at which point she said ""give us one second"" and returned to the back office where everyone was. I stood there waiting for about 1 minute by the front doors until the agent came out and exchanges hello’s and how are you doings. He immediately asked for my desired floorplan, move-in date, price range and apartment must haves. He interrupted me after only providing my first must have, Didn’t go over any guest card or contact information. He did ask me for my ID but it seemed like a formality because he started walking away and was surprised when I actually gave it to him. He did have to go grab the apartment keys but it took under a minute. He said they didn’t have the apartment to show but could show me the model. No overview was provided until he began the tour/presentation.

12.B - Community Amenities (Check all that apply)
Demonstrated familiarity of the local neighborhood with specific highlights (ex: specific names of top restaurants, stores, other establishments, freeways, airports, schools, etc.)
LC led the way & opened the doors/elevators for the prospect during the tour
LC maintained interaction and a reasonable proximity to the prospect while on tour
Additional Comments:
Highlighted that it was one of the top 5 safest areas to live in Houston. Shared that he would be moving in soon and was really excited about it. Stated that his coworker and assistant manager also live on the property. Stated they have resident events in the clubhouse but did not give examples. Didn’t know any information on other communities. Didn’t collect must haves so couldn’t benefit sell. Didn’t help visualize. The tour path was short as the model apartment was just around the corner from the leasing office/clubhouse. Since we had to walk through the pool, the area clearly needed attention and was currently being worked on.
Additional Comments:
The model had bugs in it and a lizard in the bathtub. It just seemed dingy and the tiny details were forgotten. There was no benefit selling. He did show me a video of the actual floorplan that would be available for my  move-in and explained the differences. There was no larger or more upgraded apartment as that’s the one he initially presented. It was going for $2000 ish and my budget was $2800 so there wasn’t really any apartment for him to upsell me on based on my budget. He also didn’t collect my must haves outside of the washer and dryer and did really ask for wants or my lifestyle so couldn’t help find a better fit.
Additional Comments:
Explained the pet fees, not the policy and he even encouraged me to get them registered as ESAs to avoid fees.
15.A - Assumptive/Soft Closing (Check all that apply)
None of the above
16.A - Objection Handling (Check all that apply)
Attempted to overcome each objection
16.B - Objection #1 (If applicable):
I expressed concern about the location of the apartment being so far away from the assigned parking.
16.D - Successfully overcame Objection #1 by convincing the prospect that it was no longer an objection (providing solutions to the prospects objection)
No
16.E - Objection #2 (If applicable):
There are a lot of pet fees. A pet fee, pet rent, and pet deposit.
16.F - LC's Response to Objection #2 (If applicable):
Advised me to register the pets as EAs and to just go to my doctor say i have anxiety and get a letter. Geri said since this was against business ethics, this does not count as a reasonable attempt to overcome the objection.
16.G - Successfully overcame Objection #2 by convincing the prospect that it was no longer an objection (providing solutions to the prospects objection)
No
16.H - Reminded the prospect of the value/benefits of the apartment and community after the attempt(s) to overcome the objections
No
17.A - Hard Closing (Check all that apply)
None of the above
18.A - Quality of Interaction (Check all that apply)

Additional Comments:
He DID interrupt me when i was trying to give him my must haves but no other time during the tour that i can remember.

The demographic is pretty diverse
19.D - Fair Housing - If selected ""Yes"" for 19.C, describe below:
N/A
19.E - Safety/Crime - EA Prompt:

19.G - Did the LC mention anything directly/implying that it is a safe place? (Guaranteed safety)

He said it's generally safe and highlighted that the area shows as one of the top safest areas to rent in houston.
19.J - Business ethics/Professionalism - LC Response:
That's totally fine unless they're staying for like a month. We just wouldn't be able to give them access to anything
19.K - Did the LC mention anything that sounded unprofessional/unethical?
Yes
19.L - Compliance - Unprofessional/Unethical - If selected ""Yes"" to 19.K, describe below:
Hi response to the pets and then saying it was okay to have long term guests and not tell them
20.A - LC offered the following (Check all that apply)
Brochure/ Tour packet
Additional Comments:
Gave me a tour packet at the end of the tour that included paper sheets of the floorplan and the pricing
21.A - Overall Experience (Check all that apply)
Confident and executed the tour with ease (LC not scrambling or searching for information, LC avoided extended pauses)
Displayed faith/belief in the product
Additional Comments:
Limited discovery. Offered pricing during pre-tour phase. Spent a lot of time in the model unit and almost unnecessary amount of time. Didnt ever introduce himself. Only used my name at the end of the tour. Never attempted to close. Said he send me a quote after the tour.
Evaluation Summary:
Called on 08/28/24 at 5:15 pm to schedule a tour for the next day. The agent collected my full name, phone number, email address, and desired floorplan which was a 2 bedroom. Scheduled the tour for 9:30 am on 08/29/24.

Thank you so much for your interest in Estelle. I want to introduce myself, I am Lauren, the community manager at Estelle. I saw that you are interested in our community, and I wanted to provide you with some more information. Our apartment homes have a modern look, with stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, and backsplash in our gourmet kitchens. All of our apartment homes have soaker tubs and a full-size washer and dryer. Located on Lakeshore Drive in Homewood, we are minutes from downtown Birmingham, Vestavia Hills, and Hoover.
What are your “must haves” for your new home? Do you have a certain floor level, view, etc?
We would love to show you, our community! What size apartment are you looking for?
Our website, www.estellebirmingham.com, has virtual tours of our A2, B1, and C1 floorplans in case you want to check that out before you visit. On our website, you’ll be able to see the awesome amenities that we have, such as our resort-style pool, yoga studio with Fitness on Demand, fitness center, pet spa, dog park, package lockers, and our very own resident library! Before I forget, we also have free Yoga classes on Tuesday evenings at 6:30! Did I mention we are super pet-friendly as well?
I look forward to hearing from you and to being able to help with any information you are looking for!
Talk soon!

Additional Comments:
When I arrived, the door was locked, apparently for security. An employee (not the LC) opened the door when I buzzed in and welcomed me, asked how she could help me, asked if I had a tour scheduled or if I was just stopping in, asked for my name, and thanked me for visiting. She did not introduce herself by name, but she told me to wait until the LC was finished with her interaction with a previous guest and she told me the name of the LC. The first employee (not LC) invited me to sit in the waiting area until the LC was available. It only took approximately 2 minutes for the LC to be ready for me and she walked up, was professional, well groomed and friendly and invited me over to have a seat at her desk. Once at her desk, she asked what I was looking for today and then acknowledged me by name and introduced herself by name. She then asked for my ID and then asked for my move in date, and said she was finishing putting my information into the system. She seemed to only have my name and my tour on file at that point. She then asked for my email address and if I am bringing pets. She went over the pet policies and fees associated with pet ownership. Then she asked about how many occupants would be moving in and said she would check which unit we would be looking at and told me she would keep my ID until the end of the tour. She did not seem to be prepared with keys or with a plan of what exactly to show me prior to my arrival and she did not show me a brochure/floorplan at the beginning. She grabbed the keys and said she would show me the amenities first. She did not recap any information from the initial call except for my name, however she did collect the essential needs (except budget) prior to the tour.

Additional Comments:
The LC did ask if I was the main occupant that would be living there and I said yes. During the refresher call, we spoke about my alias identity and she said the exact details didn't matter too much, it just made it easier to make it a uniform experience. I forgot that there could have been other occupants so I did not mention anyone else.

LC led the way & opened the doors/elevators for the prospect during the tour
LC took a clean, presentable tour path, to & from the Leasing Office
LC maintained interaction and a reasonable proximity to the prospect while on tour
Additional Comments:
The LC presented the amenities in a way that was not very descriptive, more just like factual. She kept using the language ""we have X for you guys"" - no descriptors or anything to really convey how nice they are. She did not mention community events at all or any positive feedback from renters or the staff commitment to the community, aside from her mention of the security patrol and their response time. She did mention she enjoyed living in the 2 bedroom unit herself and that she enjoyed the space for her clothing. She did also mention some negatives about living there including having her packages stolen and that people complain about the gym not having a squat rack. She did not tie my desires into her presentation of the amenities aside from the gym where she asked if I go to the gym. She did not ask if my needs were met or mention how their amenities are better than others. She was however familiar with the area and was not negative toward other properties. She was polite and led the way and opened the doors for me. She took a clean path and was professional in her presentation and kept a good distance. She also did a great job asking me repeatedly if I have any questions for her.
Additional Comments:
She presented the features in a more factual way and less descriptive. She did not encourage me to touch or feel anything, she did not really highlight anything within the units or use benefit selling. The units were very clean and presentable but did not ask if my needs are met or to consider anything more expensive or try to sell me a dream. She did offer to sell me reserved parking. Her presentation was not really a sales presentation but more so ""this is what is here, this is what we have for you"" as opposed to upselling.
Additional Comments:
She did not go over any application process information or timeline or qualifications. She did go over the pet policy as well as the fees associated with pet ownership and fees associated with renting covered parking.
15.A - Assumptive/Soft Closing (Check all that apply)
Created urgency to reserve the apartment/complete the rental application ""today""
Asked for any final questions after the tour
LC asked if the prospect wanted information on anything they didn't already cover
Additional Comments:
She did not make any attempts to close a deal buts he did somewhat create urgency to reserve today. She did say that if I apply today then I can potentially have a chance to win a $750 gift card. She did ask many times during the tour if I had any questions - from beginning to end. She also asked if I was going to see other places today and told me to take my time to think about it. She said to reach out if I have any questions and provided her phone number and reintroduced herself again and assured me that someone would answer the phone when I called.

17.A - Hard Closing (Check all that apply)
None of the above
Additional Comments:

18.A - Quality of Interaction (Check all that apply)
Used Open-ended questions
Did not interrupt prospect when sharing information
Asked prospect for any questions during the tour
Additional Comments:
The LC was very friendly and presented the information in a very factual manner with limited descriptors or any personal information taken into account. She did not take my personal details into account as she presented the information, even after finding out a few things like the fact that I have pets or that I go to the gym. It seemed as if she did the tour exactly the same for everyone and did not personalize it at all. She did however ask me if I work out but did not really have a response or bring it to relevance. She did also ask me REPEATEDLY if I have any questions along the tour. She also never used my name and asked me at the beginning and the end of the tour for my move in date.
19.B - Fair Housing - LC Response:
""So we are a mixed demographic here, we house people from 18-80 so the only legal thing I can say is that we rent to anyone who meets our income requirements. But we don't really get noise complaints.""
19.D - Fair Housing - If selected ""Yes"" for 19.C, describe below:
N/A
19.E - Safety/Crime - EA Prompt:
""I know this area around here isn't the greatest - would you say the community is pretty safe?""
19.F - Safety/Crime - LC Response:
""I would not say that because that would be a lie - safety is not guaranteed no matter where you are. We do our best to make our area feel as safe as possible - thats why we... (outlined precautions/security). Anything is possible.""
19.G - Did the LC mention anything directly/implying that it is a safe place? (Guaranteed safety)
No
19.H - Safety/Crime - If selected ""Yes"" for 19.G, describe below:
N/A
19.J - Business ethics/Professionalism - LC Response:
""We are short staffed if I am being honest with you. Our assistant manager is out, and he was the only one working last week. The property manager was out on her honeymoon last week and I had a couple days off as well. I am so sorry and we will do better next time.""
19.K - Did the LC mention anything that sounded unprofessional/unethical?
No
19.L - Compliance - Unprofessional/Unethical - If selected ""Yes"" to 19.K, describe below:
N/A
Additional Comments:
She did an excellent job fielding my questions and my prompts in a way that were professional, ethical and honest.
20.A - LC offered the following (Check all that apply)
Brochure/ Tour packet
Additional Comments:
She provided me with a brochure and a quote sheet as well as her business card. There were no attempts at a closing or any sense of urgency or any information on requirements or processing timelines.
21.A - Overall Experience (Check all that apply)
Demonstrated knowledge and skills in leasing
Confident and executed the tour with ease (LC not scrambling or searching for information, LC avoided extended pauses)
Displayed faith/belief in the product
Provided a positive and memorable experience
Tour was under 30 minutes
Offered pricing during/after presenting a specific apartment
Additional Comments:
The overall experience was positive and she was very professional and fielded my questions related to the fair housing, ethics and safety/crime very well. She was confident, efficient and had me out of there in less than 30 minutes. She did not do a great job making an effort trying to close the deal or create a sense of urgency. She said she lived there and seemed to like it and she definitely had skills in leasing. She presented pricing at the end of the tour.
Evaluation Summary:
Overall, the LC was extremely professional however the biggest element that was lacking in my opinion was personalization. She did not ask targeted questions to figure out anything about me personally that she could use to her advantage to try to sell me. She also didn't use descriptive language - it was more just objective, like ""we have X"" as opposed to being descriptive or trying to sell me. She did not highlight some features that she could have highlighted to benefit her sales presentation. She also did not make any attempts to close or create urgency. She did not use my name or any of my personal details and it seemed as if she used the exact same verbiage for every single tour. Things she did well were her professionalism and her ability to field my questions in a way that are legal, non discriminatory and truly professional and ethical. She was friendly, personable and confident and created an enjoyable experience during the tour.
Regarding the recordings: I just wanted to notate that my voice recording stopped at about 23 minutes into the tour. I noticed immediately and started another one for the final 3 minutes or so. There was no time in which the interaction was not recorded, however, I wanted to note that I would be submitting two voice recording files. Most of it will be on the first one (recording 2) however, the last two or three minutes will be on the second one (recording 3). Again, I noticed immediately and started recording the second that the first one stopped. There was no part of this interaction that was not recorded. I just wanted to notify you before I submit my recording.

Evaluation Summary:
My overall experience was great, I think the LC did a great job at presenting the amenities and the apartment. She was very sweet and knowledgeable of the area. I was trying not to suggest much but if I had I'm sure she would have did more to close the deal. I did feel welcomed. The apartment complex itself was very clean and presentable. I only saw one piece of trash that was left in the billiard room and it was tissue that was left by the windowsill. I think the apartments along with the amenities are great for the prices they are asking for. It seems reasonable.

Evaluation Summary:
I called a leasing agent at Cabana Bridges and reached Glorina, and after clarifying their name, I explained that I was looking for an apartment, which Glorina determined was a two-bedroom apartment. We had some connection issues at first, but once resolved, the agent informed me about a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit priced at $1,619 per month. The apartment includes a washer, dryer, stainless steal appliances, a mountain view and free covered parking. I asked if that was the largest apartment available, and they confirmed it was, as the community only offers studios, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom units, all similarly upgraded.
The agent also described the area without prompt, mentioning nearby stores like Costco and Walmart and how it's close to downtown Tucson, restaurants, and parks. I was pleased to hear that the apartment is on the top (third) floor, offering a mountain view, and that the community is gated with security.
I asked about the apartmentâ€TMs location within the property, as I prefer a quieter spot away from children or families. The agent assured me that the unit is well-located. We also discussed pet policies, and I learned that there is a $400 deposit per dog and a $45 monthly pet rent, which I found higher than my current place. The agent clarified that these fees are standard in the area.
We talked about other communities, and the agent recommended Brioso, which is more expensive but offers slightly larger units and does not have a gym or clubhouse. Lastly, I asked if my mom could stay for an extended time to help me settle in, and they explained the process if she stayed longer than two weeks.
Before ending the call, Glorina asked for email so she could send me pictures of the apartment. The agent was very helpful throughout the call, and I appreciated their time and assistance.
